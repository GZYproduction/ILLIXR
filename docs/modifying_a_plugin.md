# Writing your plugin

## Adding a new plugin (common case)

In the common case, one need only define a `Makefile` with the line `include common/common.mk` and
symlink common (`ln -s ../common common`). This provides the necessary targets and uses the compiler
`$(CXX)`, which is defined in Make based on the OS and environment variables.

- It compiles `plugin.cpp` and any other `*.cpp` files into the plugin.

- It will invoke a recompile the target any time any `*.hpp` or `*.cpp` file changes.

- It compiles with C++17. You can change this in your plugin by defining `STDCXX = ...` before the
  `include`. This change will not affect other plugins; just yours.

- Libraries can be added by appending to `LDFLAGS` and `CFLAGS`, for example

        LDFLAGS := $(LDFLAGS) $(shell pkg-config --ldflags eigen3)
        CFLAGS := $(CFLAGS) $(shell pkg-config --cflags eigen3)

- See the source for the exact flags.

- Inserted the path of your directory into the `plugin`-list in `config.yaml`.

## Adding a plugin (general case)

Each plugin can have a completely independent build system, as long as:
- It defines a `Makefile` with targets for `plugin.dbg.so`, `plugin.opt.so`, and `clean`. Inside
  this `Makefile`, one can defer to another build system.

- It's compiler maintains _ABI compatibility_ with the compilers used in every other plugin. Using
  the same version of Clang or GCC on the same architecture is sufficient for this.

- It's path is inserted in the root `config.yaml`, in the plugin list.

## Tutorial

With this, you can extend ILLIXR for your own purposes. You can also replace any existing
functionality this way.

1.  Create a new directory anywhere for your new plugin and set it up for ILLIXR. We recommend you also push this plugin to a git repository on Github/Gitlab if you want it as a part of upstream ILLIXR in the future.

  - Create a `Makefile` with the following contents. See [Building ILLIXR][1] for more details and alternative setups.


        include common.mk

2.  You must decide if your plugin should inherit the standardized [`threadloop`][3] or
    [`plugin`][4].

  - If your plugin just needs to run one computation repeatedly, then your plugin class should
    extend [`threadloop`][3].

  - If you need custom concurrency (more complicated than a loop), triggered concurrency (by
    events fired in other plugins), or no concurrency then your plugin class should extend
    [`plugin`][4].

3.  Write a file called `plugin.cpp` with this body, replacing every instance of `plugin_name`:

        #include "common/phonebook.hpp"
        #include "common/plugin.hpp"
        #include "common/threadloop.hpp"
        
        using namespace ILLIXR;
        
        // Inherit from `plugin` if you don't need the threadloop
        class plugin_name : public threadloop {
        public:
            plugin_name(std::string name_, phonebook* pb_)
                : threadloop{name_, pb_}
                { }
            virtual void start() override { }
            virtual ~plugin_name() override { }
        };
        
        // This line makes the plugin importable by Spindle
        PLUGIN_MAIN(plugin_name);


4. At this point, you should be able to build your plugin with ILLIXR. Move to the ILLIXR repo and update `configs/native.yaml`. See [Building ILLIXR][1] for more details on the config file.

   ```
   plugin_groups:
     - !include "rt_slam_plugins.yaml"
     - !include "core_plugins.yaml"
     - plugin_group:
         - path: /PATH/TO/NEW/PLUGIN
         - path: ground_truth_slam/
         - path: gldemo/
         - path: debugview/
   
   data:
     subpath: mav0
     relative_to:
       archive_path:
         download_url: 'http://robotics.ethz.ch/~asl-datasets/ijrr_euroc_mav_dataset/vicon_room1/V1_02_medium/V1_02_medium.zip'
   demo_data: demo_data/
   loader:
     name: native
     # command: gdb -q --args %a
   profile: opt
   ```

   

5. Finally, run ILLIXR with your new plugin with the following command: `./runner.sh configs/native.yaml`

6. This is all that is required to be a plugin which can be loaded by Spindle in the ILLIXR
   runtime. Reading and writing from Phonebook and Switchboard optional, but nearly every plugin
   does it. See `default_plugins.md` for more details.

   First, we can query the [`phonebook`][2] to get various services including [`switchboard`][5]. Then we
   query [`switchboard`][5] for event-streams (topics). We will read `topic1`, write to `topic2`, and
   schedule computation on `topic 3`. See the API documentation for `phonebook` and `switchboard`
   for more details.


        #include "common/phonebook.hpp"
        #include "common/plugin.hpp"
        #include "common/threadloop.hpp"
    
        /* When datatypes have to be common across plugins
          (e.g. a phonebook service or switchboard topic),
           they are defined in this header,
           which is accessible to all plugins. */
        #include "common/data_format.hpp"
    
        class plugin_name : public threadloop {
        public:
            /*
                After the constructor, C++ permits a list of member-constructors.
                We use uniform initialization (curly-braces) [1] instead of parens to avoid ambiguity [2].
                We put the comma at the start of the line, so that lines can be copied around or deleted freely (except for the first).
